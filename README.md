Time_OS is a minimalist productivity app designed for students to manage tasks, classes, and daily schedules without mental overload.

Instead of forcing users to manually rearrange tasks every time their schedule changes, Time_OS acts like a smart assistant that helps organize work around real-life events.
🚩 Problem Statement

Students often face these issues:

Classes get cancelled or postponed unexpectedly

Large tasks feel overwhelming

Manually rescheduling tasks wastes time and causes stress

Existing apps are either too complex (Notion) or too manual (to-do lists)

Time_OS solves this by combining simplicity with intelligent scheduling.

🎯 What Time_OS Does (In Simple Terms)

You enter your weekly fixed schedule (classes, gym, meals).

You add tasks with duration and deadline — not exact timings.

The app automatically:

Finds free time

Breaks big tasks into smaller sessions

Spreads them across days before the deadline

If your schedule changes, the app adjusts tasks automatically.

👉 You stay in control — the app just removes the planning effort.

✨ Key Features
